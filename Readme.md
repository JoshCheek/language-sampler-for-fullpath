Language Sampler For Fullpath
=============================

Fullpath is a program I initially wrote in Ruby
(source is [here](https://github.com/JoshCheek/dotfiles/blob/3cabefef72d2d97639f213726b8cd2550740ea7b/bin/fullpath)).
It makes a good small but still useful program (I use it very frequently)
to try out for a new language, so I'm going to try writing it in
new languages as I try to learn them.

Languages
---------

### Go

Build:

```sh
$ go build -o golang/fullpath golang/fullpath.go
```

Run with the interpreter:

```sh
$ go run golang/fullpath.go
```
