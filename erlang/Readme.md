[Erlang](https://www.erlang.org)
================================

Took quite a while to find the escript executable,
but that seems to be the way to run it as an executable.

To inspect a value: `erlang:display(SomeVar)`

No idea how I installed it (it was already installed),
probably homebrew.

It was pretty smooth to get this going. Maybe playing around
with Elixir made it straightforward.

There's clearly a lot I haven't experienced yet,
primarily around the concurrency.

On the whole, I enjoyed it, I'd play with Erlang again.
